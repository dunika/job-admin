    <description>Senior Compliance Officer - Dublin
 About the job!
 As a Senior member of the Compliance Advisory Department, you&amp;#39;ll be supporting the activities of three Irish regulated entities and reporting directly to the head of Compliance (PCF12) for whom you&amp;#39;ll deputise on boards and committees.
 The day-to-day consists of regular interaction with the Regulator and internal stakeholders: giving advice, answering queries, identifying risks and you will have consistent contact with C-Suite executives; both in Ireland and abroad.
 There is a huge amount of responsibility and senior interaction in this role and you&amp;#39;ll likely be the type of person who can take over this function in the future - the opportunities in this organisation are as large as your ambition.
 Salary and benefits incredibly competitive and commensurate with experience
 So what about you?
 You should be technically proficient with solid knowledge of AIFMD and UCITS, have a Senior Compliance background in Funds or have regulatory Experience within an Asset Manager - AML is a separate function so this is not experience that will be considered nor will compliance from other areas of Financial Services.
 The detailed view:

 &amp;bull; Assist in providing strategic direction to the Compliance team in Ireland, identifying compliance risks (current and emerging) and ensuring these get appropriate visibility and focus across the wider company.
 &amp;bull; Provide clear, accurate and timely guidance and advice to senior management on regulatory matters, potentially within tight deadlines at senior fora
 &amp;bull; Where required to do so, act as a day-to-day contact with the local regulatory authority and undertake both oral and written communications, where necessary, in conjunction with line management. This involves contributing to and influencing business around the content of regulatory submissions to ensure appropriate disclosures and accuracy.
 &amp;bull; Represent Compliance within business-driven projects and, where required, regulatory change related projects - from analysis to implementation. 
 &amp;bull; Act as a senior point of contact between the business and the Compliance function
 &amp;bull; Provide constructive and effective challenge to help ensure that regulatory obligations are taken account of and met.
 &amp;bull; Provide technical support, leadership, and guidance to more junior members of the team, helping them to expand their own knowledge base within the Compliance function. Demonstrating leadership and professionalism to junior members
 &amp;bull; Represent Compliance at relevant management/Committee/Board meetings, where required, ensuring that Compliance reports are delivered in a timely, clear and succinct way and provide effective and constructive challenge to other business line/business partner colleagues.
 &amp;bull; Represent the company at relevant industry events and, where required, on industry trade bodies/working groups.
 &amp;bull; Meet with Compliance teams from client base, if required. These meetings may be part of a client&amp;#39;s regular due diligence of the company as a service provider or prospective service provider.
 &amp;bull; Participate in and/or lead the delivery of Compliance-related training to business line/business partner colleagues.
 &amp;bull; If required, and subject to regulatory approval, perform the role of Compliance Officer for the Dublin branch

    <description>Role: Area Sales Manager - Tool and Powered Access Hire

Location: Dublin Airport

Salary: &amp;euro;40,000 - &amp;euro;45,000 Basic, quarterly bonus, pension, phone, tablet + CAR

AREA SALES MANAGER - TOOL AND POWERED ACCESS HIRE:

My client is a leading Tool and Powered Access rental business in the Republic of Ireland. A decision has been made to recruit a role for an Area Sales Manager to cover the Dublin Airport area to specifically look after existing accounts and try and secure new accounts across the area.

This is an exciting and challenging role, with the opportunity to take control and responsibility for a thriving part of the business. The role will be a combination of managing existing accounts and to also try and develop new business opportunities across the busy Dublin Airport area. The role reports directly into the Sales Manager for Ireland and has the overall objective of increasing the turnover and profitability of the business in the area.

Ideally, you will be someone who has exceptional knowledge of Tool and Powered Access Hire and have a proven record of selling such products. However, if you have experience of the hire sector in general then you would be considered. You must be a solution based sales person who has excellent closing skills and have the ability to manage existing accounts as well as the skillset to create new business opportunities.

You must be able to work autonomously and to your own structure as this is a field based role to cover the Dublin Airport region. However, strong team interaction skills are required as you will be working closely with the operations side of the business as well as the wider area sales team and your line manager.

If you would like to be considered for this position, please forward your current CV with a covering letter at your earliest convenience, stating your suitability for the role</description>
